### Welcome to the Puppercoin contract deployment!

This project will require you to use MetaMask

Using these simple contracts and the instructions provided you can easily deploy and use the PupperCoins, or after a bit of simple editing - anything you'd want!
Provided below will be easy to follow screenshots and some basic instructions to get this bad boy up and running! 


### Lets get this show on the road!

The first step is to copy the code files over onto your system, and boot them through remix.ethereum.org. Open both of the supplied .sol files, and compile them both.

Then, following the screenshot, please click the "Deploy" tab, and make sure you have the PupperCoinDeploy contract selected. Beside the large orange Deploy button,
click the down arrow and fill in the required information. (In this case it is PupperCoin, PUP, and 18)

After clicking deploy, MetaMask should open up and ask for you to approve the transaction. Once approved, please click the "Assets" tab, and scroll down to "Add New Token".
Copying the address from the deployed contract (Second screenshot - see: token_address). Copy the address into MetaMask, it should autofill, and viola!

Entering the address and sending the required currency should result in the purchase of a token! Congratulations - You now own PupperCoin!
